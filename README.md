# Recipe Site

This is my first Odin Project repository. 

I'm planning to update it along my education. 

At first (2024/02/10) it will contain only basic html structure, no styling or interactivy. 

TO-DO:
1. Once I complete Odin's sections on CSS and Flexbox - add recipes for 12 total recipes, implement some styling and centring on index page, as well as on individual recipe's pages.
2. Once I complete Odin's sections on JS Fundamentals - implement Like|Dislike button and the ability to filter recipes according to the button state. And add 12 more recipes.
